Frequency Analysis

What difficulties did you run into writing the frequency analysis program? How did you resolve these problems?

    I had a few issues with declaring the methods to throw errors, but once I googled the problem, I 
    figured out a way to fix it


How closely did the frequencies of letters in the plaintext and the ciphertext correspond? 

    They were pretty close sometimes, but they could very up to 1.5% and that sometimes made things 
    confusing


What could be done to improve the accuracy of the correspondence?

    Use larger bodies of text for analysis, especially the ciphertext because that was smaller


This assignment involved writing a program and then interpreting the results the old fashioned way. Propose an extension 
to this project that would allow the computer to do all the work so that you only have to evaluate whether the decoded message 
makes senses. You donâ€™t need to actually write another program to do this, just consider how it could be done and clearly 
describe your solution in a well-written paragraph.

        To have the program evaluate it, you would need to store the frequencies in several arrays. Then you would
    need to make a method that sifts through them and matches them up in descending order. After that, it would
    print it to the user, and the user would evaluate it and the program would take input as to whether its correct.
    If it is wrong, then it would go back and find the two closest pairs, and swap them. It will continue to repeat 
    this process until the user thinks that the output is correct.
