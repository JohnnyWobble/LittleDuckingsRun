<S+>:
    I think recursion is really cool, and I had a lot of fun playing around with it
<S->:
    I originally wrote my program without OOP, but then after I went back to do OOP it ended up being 
    longer and more convoluted than before. So I think the best way to write this program, would be 
    the functional style.
In the future:
    I will write a Fibonacci calculator with a functional style.
